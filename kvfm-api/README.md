# Try Out Development Containers: .NET Core

This is a sample project that lets you try out the **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)** extension in a few easy steps.

> **Note:** If you're following the quick start, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section. 

## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the ".NET Core" sample, wait for the container to start and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use **Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem.

   Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

3. If you want to enable **HTTPS**, see [enabling HTTPS](#enabling-https) to reuse your local development cert in the container.

## Things to try

One you have this sample opened in a container, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default. Comment out `"remoteUser": "vscode"` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you'd prefer to run as root.

Some things to try:

1. **Restore Packages:** When notified by the C# extension to install packages, click Restore to trigger the process from inside the container!

2. **Edit:**
   - Open `Program.cs`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features.

3. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `dotnet --version` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.

4. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `Program.cs`
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 21).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
   - Continue, then open a local browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` and note you can connect to the server in the container.

5. **Forward another port:**
   - Stop debugging and remove the breakpoint.
   - Open `appsettings.Development.json`
   - Update `"Url": "http://localhost:5000"` to `"Url": "http://localhost:9000"`.
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Forward a Port** command.
   - Select port 9000.
   - Click "Open Browser" in the notification that appears to access the web app on this new port.

### Enabling HTTPS

To enable HTTPS for this sample, you can mount an exported copy of a locally generated dev certificate. Note that these instructions assume you already have the `dotnet` CLI installed on your local operating system.

1. Enable HTTPS in the sample by updating the `env` property in `.vscode/launch.json` as follows:

   ```json
   "env": {
         "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "HttpsDevelopment"
   }
   ```

2. Next, export the SSL cert using the following command:

    **Windows PowerShell**

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "$env:USERPROFILE/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
    ```

    **macOS/Linux terminal**

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
    ```

3. Add the following in to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

    ```json
    "remoteEnv": {
        "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password": "SecurePwdGoesHere",
        "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path": "/home/vscode/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx",
    }
    ```

4. Finally, make the certificate available in the container as follows:

    **If using GitHub Codespaces and/or Remote - Containers**

    1. Start the container/codespace
    2. Drag `~/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx` from your local machine into the root of the File Explorer in VS Code.
    3. Open a terminal in VS Code and run:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p /home/vscode/.aspnet/https && mv aspnetapp.pfx /home/vscode/.aspnet/https
        ```

    **If using only Remote - Containers with a local container**

    Add the following to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

    ```json
    "mounts": [ "source=${env:HOME}${env:USERPROFILE}/.aspnet/https,target=/home/vscode/.aspnet/https,type=bind" ]
    ```

5. If you've already opened your folder in a container, rebuild the container using the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) so the settings take effect.

Next time you debug using VS Code (<kbd>F5</kbd>), you'll be able to use HTTPS! Note that you will need to specifically navigate to `https://localhost:5001` to get the certificate to work (**not** `https://127.0.0.1:5001`).
